# Research Insights: Copyright Protection in AI Image Generation

This blog post explores some of the mathematical concepts underlying our recent work on "Guardians of Generation: Dynamic Inference-Time Copyright Shielding with Adaptive Guidance for AI Image Generation."

## Problem Formulation

Let's define the problem mathematically. Given a diffusion model $f_\theta$ and a copyright-protected reference image $I_r$, we aim to prevent the generation of images $I_g$ that are too similar to $I_r$ according to some similarity metric $\mathcal{S}(I_g, I_r)$.

The generation process can be formulated as:

$$I_g = f_\theta(z, c, t)$$

Where:
- $z$ is the noise input
- $c$ is the conditioning (e.g., text prompt)
- $t$ represents the timesteps in the diffusion process

## Adaptive Guidance Mechanism

Our approach introduces an adaptive guidance mechanism that modifies the generation process:

$$\tilde{f}_\theta(z, c, t) = f_\theta(z, c, t) - \lambda(t) \nabla_{I_t} \mathcal{S}(I_t, I_r)$$

Where:
- $I_t$ is the intermediate generated image at timestep $t$
- $\lambda(t)$ is a dynamic weight function that varies with the timestep
- $\nabla_{I_t} \mathcal{S}(I_t, I_r)$ is the gradient of the similarity with respect to the current image

The adaptive function $\lambda(t)$ is defined as:

$$\lambda(t) = \begin{cases}
\alpha \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)^\beta & \text{if } \mathcal{S}(I_t, I_r) > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ controls the overall strength of the guidance
- $\beta$ controls how quickly the guidance increases as $t$ decreases
- $\tau$ is a threshold for when to apply the guidance
- $T$ is the total number of timesteps

## Similarity Metrics

We explored several similarity metrics $\mathcal{S}$, including:

1. **CLIP Similarity**:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{CLIP}}(I_1, I_2) = \frac{E_{\text{CLIP}}(I_1) \cdot E_{\text{CLIP}}(I_2)}{||E_{\text{CLIP}}(I_1)|| \cdot ||E_{\text{CLIP}}(I_2)||}$$

2. **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{SSIM}}(I_1, I_2) = \frac{(2\mu_{I_1}\mu_{I_2} + C_1)(2\sigma_{I_1 I_2} + C_2)}{(\mu_{I_1}^2 + \mu_{I_2}^2 + C_1)(\sigma_{I_1}^2 + \sigma_{I_2}^2 + C_2)}$$

3. **Perceptual Loss**:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{Perceptual}}(I_1, I_2) = \sum_{l} w_l \cdot ||F_l(I_1) - F_l(I_2)||_2^2$$

Where $F_l$ represents the activations at layer $l$ of a pre-trained network.

## Experimental Results

Our method achieves a balance between copyright protection and generation quality. We measured this using:

$$\text{Protection Rate} = \frac{n_{\text{protected}}}{n_{\text{total}}} \times 100\%$$

$$\text{Quality Preservation} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{Q}(I_i, c_i)$$

Where $\mathcal{Q}$ is a quality metric comparing the generated image to the conditioning.

## Future Directions

Future work includes optimizing the adaptive function $\lambda(t)$ through reinforcement learning:

$$\lambda_{\phi}^*(t) = \arg\max_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{z,c}[R(f_\theta, \lambda_{\phi}, z, c, I_r)]$$

Where $R$ is a reward function balancing protection and quality, and $\phi$ are the parameters of the dynamic weight function.

This approach promises to provide more nuanced control over the copyright protection mechanism while maintaining generation quality.
