# LaTeX Math Examples for AI Research

This post demonstrates how LaTeX can be used to express complex mathematical concepts in AI research.

## Fundamental Equations

Einstein's famous equation states that $$E = mc^2$$, which relates energy ($$E$$), mass ($$m$$), and the speed of light ($$c$$).

The Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$.

## Neural Networks

The activation of a neuron in a neural network can be computed as:

$$a = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\right)$$

Where:
- $$\sigma$$ is the activation function
- $$w_i$$ are the weights
- $$x_i$$ are the inputs
- $$b$$ is the bias

## Deep Learning

The cross-entropy loss function commonly used in classification:

$$L = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{C}y_{ij}\log(p_{ij})$$

Where:
- $$N$$ is the number of samples
- $$C$$ is the number of classes
- $$y_{ij}$$ is a binary indicator if class $$j$$ is the correct classification for sample $$i$$
- $$p_{ij}$$ is the predicted probability that sample $$i$$ belongs to class $$j$$

## Statistical Formulas

The normal distribution probability density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$

Where $$\mu$$ is the mean and $$\sigma$$ is the standard deviation.

## Optimization

Gradient descent update rule:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$

Where:
- $$\theta_t$$ is the parameter at time step $$t$$
- $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate
- $$\nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$ is the gradient of the cost function
