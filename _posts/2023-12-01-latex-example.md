# LaTeX Math Example

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates LaTeX rendering capabilities. LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is particularly good at displaying mathematical equations.

## Inline Math

Einstein's famous equation states that $$E = mc^2$$, which relates energy ($$E$$), mass ($$m$$), and the speed of light ($$c$$).

The Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$.

## Display Math

The quadratic formula provides solutions to the equation $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Here's the famous Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

## Matrices

A matrix can be represented as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Calculus

The definition of a derivative:

$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

And the integral:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$

## Statistical Formulas

The normal distribution probability density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$

Where $$\mu$$ is the mean and $$\sigma$$ is the standard deviation.

## Machine Learning Formulas

The cross-entropy loss function:

$$L = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{C}y_{ij}\log(p_{ij})$$

Where:
- $$N$$ is the number of samples
- $$C$$ is the number of classes
- $$y_{ij}$$ is a binary indicator if class $$j$$ is the correct classification for sample $$i$$
- $$p_{ij}$$ is the predicted probability that sample $$i$$ belongs to class $$j$$

## Neural Networks

The activation of a neuron in a neural network can be computed as:

$$a = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\right)$$

Where:
- $$\sigma$$ is the activation function
- $$w_i$$ are the weights
- $$x_i$$ are the inputs
- $$b$$ is the bias
